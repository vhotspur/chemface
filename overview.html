Chemface is a simple command-line utility for generating chemical formulaes from their SMILES notation.

<p>Chemface does not implements complete SMILES because not all elements
are recognised and also cycles are not supported but has a nice extension
that allows literally specify node string.
This literal string must be enclosed in apostrophes and could have
subscripts and superscripts defined using the T<sub>E</sub>X syntax.
After all, go see the samples (<code>ant samples</code>).</p>
