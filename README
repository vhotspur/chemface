Chemface - converter of SMILES notation into PNG
================================================

Chemface is a simple converter of SMILES notation [1,2] into PNG image.

Chemface does not implement full SMILES, however it adds a so called literal
that allows specification of arbitrary string to appear in molecule node
(thing not supported by standard SMILES).

Example usage
-------------
In these examples, `chemface' is a call to Java interpreter with path to 
directory with Chemface (compiled) sources.

$ chemface -o out.png "CCCC"
- creates butane in out.png file
$ chemface -o out.png "CC(C)(C)C"
- braces allows you to specify branches, this examples creates 
  2,2-dimethylpropane
$ chemface -o out.png "'H2SO4'"
- literal automatically parses subscripts to create formulae of sulfur acid
$ chemface --font=Verdana "'CH2'='CH''CH2''CH3'"
- again creates butene but uses literal for nodes and also uses Verdana font
  for typesetting the formulae
$ chemface -h
- prints short help

Compilation etc.
----------------
Used tools
	* Apache Ant version 1.7.1 [3]
	* java version "1.6.0_13" [4]
	* bison (GNU Bison) 2.4.1 [5]
	* Commons CLI [6] (included in distribution)
	* JGraphT [7] (included in distribution)
Building and running
	* `ant compile' compiles the sources
	* `ant all-samples' runs samples
	* `ant docs' generates javadoc and Doxygen documentation
	* `ant clean' cleans generated files
	* `ant dist' creates package with source files
Installation
	After compiling, you may install Chemface by running `ant install'.
By default, Chemface is installed into /usr/local/share/java/chemface and
launchers into /usr/local/bin. You can change the prefix by defining
PREFIX when calling ant (e.g. `ant -DPREFIX=/usr'). When building a package,
you might want to use the DESTDIR property.
